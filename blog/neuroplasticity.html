      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <h3>The Principles of Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
        Traditionally, it was thought that our brains are only malleable during childhood, and that once we reach adulthood, no new changes could be made. Over time however, this thinking has changed, and researchers now know that brain plasticity - or our brain’s ability to reorganize, both physically and functionally - is ongoing, and with repeated instruction and training, we can improve brain function at any age.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The implications of this are huge. Of course, it goes without saying that people who have experienced brain trauma are going to benefit hugely from the revelation that brain function can be improved at any age, however how can we apply these principles to the process of learning to gain a better understanding of the benefits for all?
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a moment to look through the 10 Principles of Neuroplasticity:

      </figure>
      <p>
        As you read through the 10 Principles of Neuroplasticity, you’ll see that each of these principles can easily be applied not only to those undergoing brain rehabilitation following trauma, but in fact, to learning any new skill or task. Learning can often be a challenging journey, often plagued with clouds of uncertainty and doubt. How often have you heard the words “I just can’t do this?” from either yourself, or a loved one who was trying to learn something new. Often, I bet. However, if we were to take a step back for a moment, and reflect on how an understanding of these principles can help reframe our approach to learning, we begin to see a break in those clouds, and optimism shines through.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Once we begin to understand that learning is a process, and every person, at any age, has the ability to improve their brain function by incorporating these principles into their learning approach, the benefits are endless. When met with challenges in learning, we can become motivated by an understanding that learning can be difficult, but not impossible. All it takes is a bit of time, patience and belief in our own abilities.
      </p>
      <h3>Engaging with the Concept</h3>
      <p>
        The principles of neuroplasticity are going to be fundamental as I move through the remainder of the Dev Academy course, and for life-long learning beyond. Thus far, we’re only in the early stages, however web development has already proven itself to be something I find challenging. Whilst all of the 10 principles can be applied to this learning journey, there are a few that stick out more than others which could be particularly beneficial to keep in mind as I move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="inline">Use it and improve it:</span> When embarking on a new task, the initial process of applying the new information to complete a task can be slow and clumsy. Over the weekend just passed, I already found myself frustrated that half the exercises I attempted, I got wrong, and I was constantly referring back to my notes to try and figure out how to complete the problems. By understanding that practice will lead to improved speed and performance, motivation to persevere increases, and persevere we do, because we know that practice will lead to growth, and strengthen the neuron connections in our brains.
      </p>      
      <p>
        <span class="inline">Salience:</span> In order to increase motivation, I should engage in experiences that are meaningful to me. Understanding this, allows me to take control of my learning, and direct it in a way which will help me remember the skills or pieces of information I am learning. If I find that I’m not engaged in an idea or activity, I should consider how I can reframe the taks, activity or idea to increase my motivation.
      </p>      
      <p>
        <span class="inline">Repetition:</span> Knowing that repetition is required in order to master a skill, provides motivation to form daily habits. Similar to ‘use it and improve it’, we must continue to practice the things that we learn to help wire those new skills into our brains. Coding for a little each day, and incorporating mindfulness into the daily routine are examples of how repetition can be used to our benefit.
      </p>      
      <p>
        <span class="inline">Intensity:</span> If we’re not challenged, we won’t improve. Engaging with this idea, when approaching a difficult task will help remind us that if we want to ‘level up’ we need to be working on tasks that are the next step up.
      </p>      
      <p>
        <span class="inline">Time:</span> In all cases, it’s crucial to remember that there will be times when learning happens quickly, and times when progress is slower. Patience is a virtue, and I need to remember this, and show kindness to myself, particularly during those slower times.
      </p>
      <h3>Increasing Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is increased through the process of exercising our brains. When we learn new skills, or complete challenging tasks, we are exercising our brains, allowing it to become stronger and more connected. In addition to this, it’s also important to incorporate rest and relaxation, allowing our brains time to heal and rejuvenate after being exercised. Incorporating a healthy balance of brain exercise, and rest, along with physical exercise and a healthy diet will lead to increased neuroplasticity.

        Second Wind Movement provides a helpful <a id="link" href="https://secondwindmovement.com/neuroplasticity/" target="_blank">9 step guide to increasing brain neuroplasticity</a>:
      </p>
      <h4>1. Find Clarify</h4>
      <p>
        Before we embark on a journey to change our behaviours, it’s important to have clarity about not only what we want to accomplish, but also why we want to accomplish it. Understanding our core values, priorities and personality trains will play a key role in increasing neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Set Meaningful Goals</h4>
      <p>
        Once we have clarity, it’s important to set meaningful goals for ourselves, so that we have an understanding of what we are working towards, and what we are trying to achieve. Having meaningful goals, will set ourselves up for lifelong learning as we continue to pursue those goals.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Take Micro-Steps</h4>
      <p>
        Accomplishing a goal can be a daunting task if we only focus on the big picture. Breaking a goal down into smaller micro-steps will allow us to focus on specific tasks that we can accomplish each and every day as we work towards our goal - without leaving us feeling overwhelmed and unable to determine where to begin.
      </p>
      <h4>4. Adopt a Growth Mindset</h4>
      <p>
        Embrace the challenge, and look at ‘failures’ as an opportunity for growth and development. Adopting a growth mindset helps us to understand that our brains have the power to evolve and change, and we do have the capacity to learn new skills.
      </p>
      <h4>5. Practice Mindfulness</h4>
      <p>
        Mindfulness builds self awareness. An awareness of our thoughts, or emotions and our behaviours. Through increased self awareness, we are more likely to be conscious of what’s happening in our brain, and respond appropriately to certain triggers which allow us to make better decisions. Exercises such as journaling, meditation and taking time out from the distractions of technology can all have huge benefits on increasing neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <h4>6. Carefully Select Your Circle of Influence</h4>
      <aside>
        <p>‘Show me your friends, and I’ll show you your future.'</p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        It has been said that you are who you surround yourself with. Spend time around people who have similar core values. Create meaningful experiences by engaging with people who will push you, challenge you, and ultimately support you in becoming a better version of yourself.
      </p>
      <h4>7. Prioritize an Exercise Routine</h4>
      <p>
        Healthy body, healthy mind - right? Try to incorporate some form of exercise into your daily schedule.
      </p>
      <h4>8. Stop Procrastinating</h4>
      <p>
        The first key principle in neuroplasticity is ‘Use it, or lose it’. If you want to make change, you need to act.
      </p>
      <h4>9. Raise Your Standards</h4>
      <p>
        Try to hold yourself accountable in following these nine steps consistently, and diligently. Always keep your purpose in mind and be proactive about making change.
      </p>
      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h3>What is a Growth Mindset?</h3>
      <p>
        Growth mindset (in contrast to fixed mindset) refers to the understanding and belief that our intelligence and habits can be developed over time. It encourages us to take a positive approach to learning, by embracing our mistakes and limitations, and seeing them as opportunities for growth and development. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Adopting a growth mindset is particularly relevant in the learning process, as it’s important for us to believe in ourselves, and our abilities to learn new things, and overcome the obstacles that we will likely encounter along the way.

      <h3>Surprises and Changes</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve been familiar with the term ‘Growth Mindset’ for some time given my background in education, and really appreciate and embrace the idea when directing it towards my students and their learning. I guess the thing that surprised me the most, is that even though this is the case, if I were to truly reflect on how I personally approach tasks, in certain situations, I still revert back to a fixed mindset - especially when I get overwhelmed! 
      </p>
      <p>
        Take for example, my memory. I have a terrible memory, and my ability to recall information frustrates me - often! When I get overloaded with information, I find myself referring back to the idea of ‘this is how it’s always been, and always will be’ instead of seeing this challenge as an opportunity, and understanding that if I work consistently to improve it, it will improve.
      </p>
      <h3>Growth Mindset Integration</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to the video above, I need to picture myself as the curious seed - beginning each day, and task, with a sense of curiosity about what I can learn, and how I can apply the skills I’ve already learned to reach success.
      </p>
      <p>
        I need to let go of perfection. I spend far too long trying to nail the perfect result, for fear of failure. Understanding however, the ‘perfect’ doesn’t exist, will allow me to put my best foot forward, without exhausting myself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Already, I’ve started to incorporate the idea of ‘Yet’ into my learning. Through all of the Codecademy challenges that I didn’t accomplish last week, or was unable to complete without guided help, I showed kindness to myself through an understanding that I hadn’t mastered the concepts ‘yet’. Heck! It’s only been a week of Javascript - so why be so harsh on yourself? Throughout the process, I am continuing to learn, and I’ll get there, it just might take some time. By fostering the idea of ‘yet’ into my learning, it’ll help me stay focussed, and understand that I will get there - even if it takes some time!
      </p>
      <p>
        Embracing challenges as adventures, and mistakes as opportunities will be crucial. At the end of the day, what am I learning if I get everything right first? And is this even realistic? Definitely not. For every mistake, there is an opportunity. Why did I make that mistake? What was wrong? How do I fix it? These are ideas that I can take with me through every aspect of learning.
      </p>
      <h2>Blending with the Learning Plan</h2>
      <p>
        As I reflect back through my learning plan, I think a lot of the information from this exploration is already incorporated in there though could be articulated better, or developed further. Definitely, the principles of neuroplasticity reinforce the need to work on clear goal setting, and the importance of establishing healthy, daily habits. I really liked the 9 step process to increasing neuroplasticity that I listed above, and think this is something that I’ll need to revisit, and be conscious of in my development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel the idea of a growth mindset has a huge role to play in managing expectations, and being kind to myself as I plan to move forward for the remainder of the course. Continuing on with the concept of ‘Yet’ will be important, as we are constantly faced with new challenges, which will create pitfalls and frustrations in our learning journey. Understanding that growth and development comes with practice and application - an understanding of neuroplasticity coupled with a growth mindset will be the keys to success.
