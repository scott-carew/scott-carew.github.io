      <h1>How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?</h1>

      <h2>Where are YOU Scooby Doo?</h2>
      <p>
        So I set out today on a mission - find Scooby Doo! Apparently he was hiding behind a door, and it was my job to figure out which one. Truth be told, I checked the tests, so I knew where he was hiding. I guess to put it better, it was my job to help Javascript find out which door he was hiding behind by completing the function.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img class="images" src="../images/scoobyhiding.jpeg" alt="Scooby in Trash Can">
      </div>
      <p>
        According to the instructions, to help, I might like to try using <code>console.log</code> (which basically outputs a message to the web console) or check the information in the included tests for the task. I‚Äôd do both. First up, let's try <code>console.log</code>.
      </p>
      <code>console.log(arr)</code>
      <p>
        Nothing. Well, worse than nothing - big red scary text! Something about ‚Äòarr‚Äô being ‚Äòundefined‚Äô? This message seemed vaguely familiar, though I couldn't quite recall exactly what it meant, or how to fix it. However I knew where the tests were - so I decided to go and have a look at those instead!
      </p>
      <p>
        As I looked through the tests, my eyes were immediately drawn to line number 17. Door 1! Scooby was ‚Äòhiding‚Äô behind door 1! I took a look, and I could see that the array being put into the test had curly brackets with what looked to be pairs of information inside. ‚ÄúHmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù I thought to myself - quite chuffed, ‚ÄúThis looks like an object!‚Äù. And the word ‚Äòhiding‚Äô was going to be very helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I returned, with my newfound information, to the instructions, re-read and noted the keyword ‚Äòfind‚Äô written there. This is not an array term I‚Äôve used before, so a bit of Google research was needed to figure out what it was, how it looked, and what it did. I did a bit of reading, I did a bit of note-taking, and I looked over the example. Seemed easy enough!
      </p>
      <p>
        Going back to my function, I began to write my pseudocode which would be an outline of my instructions in English. I jotted the points down, began tapping away, typing out my function. When I thought it looked pretty good - I decided to run. Red text again.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img class="images" src="../images/scoobyconfused.gif" alt="Scooby Confused">
      </div>
      <p>
        I was feeling OK at this point, I mean, it was only my first shot. I decided to go back to the example and check the code against my attempt. It looked OK to me. Sure, the examples were different, and the context was not the same - nor am I an expert by any means - but it looked pretty good. I decided to do a bit more research on Google to find some more examples, and have a look back through my notes and previous exercises for similar functions. Then, I muddled around a bit with my code, trying a bit of this, and a bit of that, but still without success. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Time to turn to Discord. I found another student who had been struggling with the same question. When I compared my code to theirs, it looked pretty similar - awesome. I was heading in the right direction. I read the thread with the facilitator, and honestly, the discussion didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense. I took a pause and re-read, slowly and out loud. Something about an empty array, and this needing to equal 0. An empty array? This was news to me! I decided to <code>console.log</code> again, but this time, inside my function. Win! I could see the information - and the empty arrays!
      </p>
      <p>
        I had an idea, and I decided to give it a go. Ran the test and BOOM! üöÄ
      </p>
      <div class="flex">
        <p class="codeblock">
          <code>1. Pass</code>
        </p>
        <p class="codeblock">
          <code>2. Pass</code>
        </p>
        <p class="codeblock">
          <code>3. Pass</code>
        </p>
        <p class="codeblock">
          <code>4. Pass</code>
        </p>
        <p class="codeblock">
          <code>5. Pass</code>
        </p>
        <p class="codeblock">
          <code>6. Pass</code>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-container flex">
        <img class="images" id="scoobysuccess" src="../images/scoobysuccess.png" alt="Scooby Dancing">
      </div>
      <p>
        Success! Scooby was found! Before moving on, I‚Äôd reread my code to get a better understanding of what happened, then went back, and updated my pseudocode so that it matched my final answer. This would help solidify my understanding, and be a good reference for later when I‚Äôll probably forget and need some prompting.
      </p>

      <p>
        While perhaps not flawless, or entirely elegant I was proud that I‚Äôd managed to pass the tests, using the tools available, and my problem solving skills to do so. Problems don‚Äôt have to be stressful, and it‚Äôs fine if they‚Äôre not solved immediately. Just use the tools you have in your toolbox, and try to approach each problem with a fresh mind, and a clear goal.
      </p>
      <h2>What the Buzz?</h2>
      <p>
        Hot off the heels of my success with Scooby, I decided to tackle a swarm of bees that had apparently infected some sentences with a bunch of bizzing and buzzing. The job was clear, remove those buzzes from the sentences and spit them out again in plain old English.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img class="images" src="../images/swattingbees3.png" alt="Swatting Bees">
      </div>
      <p>
        I started out, as I had done with Scooby, reading the instructions, taking note of the key terms, researching, and making my notes before writing my pseudocode. I thought this task looked similar, yet different to a previous task I‚Äôd encountered, so I had a quick look back for reference, and I was on my way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to wrap my head around the problem better, so I decided to use <code>console.log</code> again, but this time, within the function - we learn from our mistakes! All I saw was a bunch of individual letters - which I could kinda  make out words from, but not easily! This didn‚Äôt look right? I decided to go back to my function, and place an extra space between a set of quotation marks I‚Äôd used. Interesting. It returned the words! I love it when you learn something through mistake and reflection!
      </p>
      <p>
        Feeling confident, I moved on - wrote the rest of my code, and checked it against the example. After a couple of small stumbles, and some trial and error, I passed test one and was onto test two. I read the error, refactored my code and ran again.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>‚ÄòExpected: Help! I‚Äôm surrounded by bees!!</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>‚ÄòReturned: ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äô</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing? What do you mean nothing? Back to my notes. Everything looked good. Back to google. Seems OK‚Ä¶I think?I started playing with <code>console.log</code> and that didn‚Äôt seem to help me move forward. I played around with spacing, and semicolons - either making no progress, or getting further from the solution. By this stage, I was googling things that probably weren‚Äôt helpful, the number of tabs open in my browser was increasing exponentially and agitation was setting in. Time to phone a friend.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img class="images" src="../images/swatting bees2.png" alt="Tough Bee">
      </div>
      <p>
        I reached out to a group member on Discord who had solved the problem, and they asked to see my code. ‚ÄúSo close‚Äù came the response. At this point, I think I started to become more focussed on the result rather than the process. I started questioning, and the hints that were coming back didn‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense. My mind wasn‚Äôt clear, and I was just plugging things in willy nilly - I guess you could call this the ‚Äòtry something‚Äô technique? Though, I wouldn‚Äôt say it was carried out intelligently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Messages just weren‚Äôt cutting the mustard, so I picked up the phone. I was told I was literally missing one word. Argh! So close, yet so far. Through several more hints, I determined the missing word was ‚Äòreturn‚Äô. Back to plugging away, I moved my existing return statement, and added return in places that it just didn‚Äôt make sense. More frustration. In the end, I only had one place left to put it as I'd exhausted all other options. It worked. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I looked back at the working function, it was SO obvious! I mean, the word ‚Äòreturn‚Äô was listed in the same place, in the problem above, and the one above that also. The hard part I‚Äôd done fine, I was just overlooking something so simple.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img class="images" src="../images/swattingbees1.png" alt="Dead Bee">
      </div>
      <p>
        The moral of the story, fresh eyes can make a big difference. In hindsight, I should have taken a break after finding Scooby - giving my brain a chance to rest, and my eyes a chance to regroup. I guess the key is, when faced with a problem, go back and piece it together step by step. In this case, I was focusing on the bigger picture, and overlooking the smaller details which were oh so obvious when pointed out. I guess I‚Äôm still learning to apply what I already know and I can say with certainty, this wasn't the first, and won't be the last time I overlook something simple - I'm sure.
      </p>
      <h2>A Reflection on Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
      <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
        Pseudocode - writing a simpler version of programming code in plain English before it‚Äôs implemented into a specific programming language, representing our thinking and approach to solving a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I get it. I like it and hey, sometimes I even use it! What I‚Äôm finding however, is that whilst I start off with some very vague pseudocode, my final solution to a problem is often way off the pseudocode itself after a bunch of trial and error. I generally have to return, and rewrite it AFTER I have solved the problem as it doesn‚Äôt always match. I could be better at making adjustments to my pseudocode as I go, and using it more consistently also.
      </p>
      <h3>Try Something</h3>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm pretty good at trying things. Though the things I try, I‚Äôm not always sure why I‚Äôm trying them especially when I get to the point where something I believe should work - does not. If I go back to the problem solving process, being mindful of the ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô step would be helpful. Understanding why my solutions may not be working, and being clear on my intention of what it is that‚Äôs being asked, and what I‚Äôm trying to achieve, might streamline my approach to using this method.
      </p>
      <h3>Rubber Ducky</h3>
      <p>
        The rubber ducky method is a software engineering technique that developers often use to help debug their code when they become blocked. It involves having a rubber ducky at hand, and explaining your problem to the duck. Outline what your code is supposed to do, and go into detail of explaining it line by line. Hopefully, at some point, whilst explaining the code to the duck, you‚Äôll realise that what your intending to do, is not what you‚Äôre actually doing - and huzzah! Problem solved.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img class="images" src="../images/llama.jpeg" alt="Toy Llama">
      </div>
      <p>
        I don‚Äôt have a rubber duck. I do however have a little llama. He‚Äôs been cooped up in a box for the last few years, and yesterday, I took him out, and placed him on my desk. Llama and I don‚Äôt have a great relationship - yet. I haven‚Äôt actually talked to him, and he doesn‚Äôt even have a name. Perhaps I‚Äôll invite him to breakfast this morning, and we can start getting to know each other, so that he can become my duck and help me solve my problems.
      </p>
      <h3>Reading Error Messages</h3>
      <p>
        Error messages can be particularly helpful in helping you understand why something is not working. They contain crucial pieces of information. I‚Äôve reached the point where I stop seeing them as a wall, and I‚Äôve actually started to read them. I don‚Äôt necessarily always understand what they are saying however, or how to translate that message into useful information which will help me solve my issue - instead, I generally just undo my previous step until the error goes away. I guess I need more practice with reading and interpreting error messages.
      </p>
      <h3>Console.Logging</h3>
      <p>
        <code>console.log</code> is a method which is used to write messages to the web console of our browser, and can be super useful when it comes time to solving a problem, by allowing us to see a temporary result of our code tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we were first introduced to <code>console.log</code> a couple of weeks ago, I only really used it when I was explicitly told to. I saw that others had commented in Discord, and appeared to be using it frequently to help them test their code. I didn‚Äôt really understand who, why or when to do this. As we‚Äôve progressed over the last couple of weeks, I find myself using it more often, to gain insight into what is happening with the chunks of code that I write.  I‚Äôm beginning to understand how this tool can be used to help me see where things in the code are working, and where things are potentially breaking. This is a tool that I need more practice with.
      </p>
      <h3>Googling</h3>
      <p>
        I feel that I am pretty well versed at Googling a problem when I come to it, and using a relatively thoughtful search process to do so. I turn to Google, often, when I‚Äôm stuck and generally find that I‚Äôm able to locate useful webpages and threads on topic. That being said, my ability to interpret some of those threads and breakdown the technical jargon to something I understand is still something I find challenging. Sometimes, I don‚Äôt necessarily understand the examples which have been listed, or the accompanying explanations. I guess as I progress, and my knowledge increases, so too will my ability to decipher this information and abstract what it is that I need.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking for Help</h3>
      <p>
        We have both facilitators and peers at our disposal for whom we can lean on for support when needed. Thus far, I‚Äôve used the threads other people have posted quite a lot, and they have been incredibly helpful, though I‚Äôm not the best at reaching out in a public forum and asking for help myself. Once I‚Äôve established a relationship with someone, I have no issue reaching out and asking for help, though I do find this to be quite daunting in a large public channel when I don‚Äôt know the majority of the people. I think I need to challenge myself to ask for help more readily, and lean on the support that is available, without fear of looking stupid.
      </p>
      <h3>Improving Process with Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Recently, I think reflection is something that I have started to take more serious, and am definitely becoming better at. I‚Äôve found in the last couple of weeks, that when I solve a problem, it‚Äôs not enough to reach a solution, but rather I have an internal desire to be able to understand <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> that that particular solution solved my problem. I‚Äôm becoming better at not simply moving on, but rather taking time to reflect on the process before I move onto the next step. This is something that I need to keep in mind, not only at the end of the problem solving process, but throughout also. Reflecting on the problem, the steps I‚Äôm taking to try and reach a solution, and how those steps relate to the code I‚Äôm creating will also help me work towards solving my problems more efficiently.
      </p>
      <h2>Take Home</h2>
      <p>
        It‚Äôs becoming more and more apparent that problems are a fundamental part of the life of a developer. I guess I knew this before, but now, even after only a few long weeks, I really KNOW this! Staying cool, calm and collected will help me to approach problems with a sense of purpose and clarify. And the more tools I have in my toolbox that can be used to approach those problems, the more successful I will be at solving them.
