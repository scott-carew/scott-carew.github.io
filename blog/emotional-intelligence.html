        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <h3 id="date">26 April 2022</h3>
        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>According to the Institute for Health and Human Potential, emotional intelligence (EI/EQ) refers to one's ability to recognise, understand and manage their own emotions, as well as the ability to recognize, understand and influence the emotions of those around them.</p>
        <p>It is now widely understood that emotional intelligence can play a key role in all aspects of a person’s life. Emotionally intelligent people have the ability to build stronger relationships, perform better at school and work, and are more likely to achieve both their personal and professional goals.</p> 
        <p>Psychologist and author, Daniel Goleman outlined five components that make up emotional intelligence: self awareness, self regulation, social skills, empathy and motivation.</p>
        <h3>Self Awareness</h3>
        <p>Self awareness refers not only to a person’s ability to recognise and understand their emotions, but also to an awareness of how our actions, moods and emotions can impact others.</p> 
        <p> person who is self aware, has the ability to monitor their own emotions and understand how their emotions trigger certain reactions and behaviors. They generally have a strong understanding of their own strengths and limitations, are confident within themselves and how they are perceived by those around them.</p>        
        <p>Self awareness can be cultivated and improved through practices that encourage you to pay close attention and reflect on your thoughts and emotions. These might include things such as journaling, meditation, goal setting, learning new skills and asking for constructive feedback.</p>
        
        <h3>Self Regulation</h3>        
        <p>Being aware of your emotions and how they impact your decisions, behaviors and those around us is great, however it’s equally important for us to be able to regulate and appropriately express those emotions at the right time and place.</p>        
        <p>Self regulation helps us to take responsibility for our actions, and also to be flexible in dealing with changing and challenging situations. People with strong self regulation skills tend to be better at navigating conflict and diffusing tense situations as they have a sound understanding of how their emotions can influence their behavior and so use tools and techniques to regulate their actions and express them in an appropriate manner. </p>        
        <p>In order to improve self regulation, people might try to focus on techniques that help enhance communication skills, or better navigate emotions which might be seen as challenging such as sadness, anger or jealousy. Alternatively, techniques such as cognitive reframing - or changing the way we view a situation can also be beneficial. For example taking a challenging situation, and seeing it as an opportunity for growth and development. </p>        
        <p>In all situations, what is important is the ability to acknowledge and accept your emotions for what they are rather than trying to suppress them. It is important to recognize that in all cases, we have choice in how we respond to a situation.</p>        
        <h3>Social Skills</h3>        
        <p>Humans are both complex and social creatures, and a key aspect of emotional intelligence involves our ability to build meaningful relationships and develop a better understanding of both ourselves and others. </p>        
        <p> It is not enough to simply understand our own emotions, and the emotions of others. We also need to use this understanding to determine how we interact and communicate with others. Every day, we use our social skills to build rapport and establish better relationships with those around us. This might involve active listening, verbal communication (asking questions, showing interest) and recognising that nonverbal communication skills such as eye contact and body language are equally as important.</p>        
        <h3>Empathy</h3>        
        <p>Empathy refers to our ability to see the world from another person’s perspective. Equally as important to understanding someone’s emotions however, is how we choose to respond to those feelings and understandings.</p>        
        <p>Empathy helps us to establish better relationships with others as it gives us insight into a person’s emotions, and their subsequent actions. Empathy can be fostered through active listening. Paying close attention, not only to what people say, but also how they say it through observation of non-verbal cues. When talking with people, we can ask open-ended questions to gain a better insight into a person’s thoughts, feelings and motivation, which will ultimately help us to imagine putting ourselves in their situation. Once we have a clear understanding of how a person is feeling, we can respond thoughtfully, with kindness, and try to avoid judgment.</p>        
        <h3>Motivation</h3>        
        <p>Motivation is ultimately what pushes us towards achieving our goals. When we achieve those goals, we feel more fulfilled and this generally leads to an overall improved quality of life. People who are emotionally intelligent are usually motivated beyond extrinsic factors such as money and recognition.</p>        
        <p>nstead, an emotionally intelligent person will be motivated intrinsically. They tend to be motivated by an inner desire to fulfill their goals and are driven to produce a higher quality of work based on a love of what they do, how they do it and the pleasure derived from completing the work rather than the material reward which is achieved.</p>        
        <p>Inner motivation can be improved by placing focus on small, measurable goals, and celebrating the success of your results when you achieve them. Working with others helps to maintain accountability and drives motivation to complete tasks, and working on challenging tasks ensures that things will remain new, and interesting.</p>        
        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
 
        <p>Traditionally, IQ tests were used to define a person's ‘intellect’ or ‘potential’ to achieve success in life. IQ refers to intelligence quotient and is essentially gauged by how well a person is able to use information and logic to answer a series of questions and make reasonable predictions. IQ will usually take into consideration measures of a person’s short and long term memory, problem solving ability and factor in not only the information a person can recall, but how quickly they can recall it.</p>
      
        <p>Emotional intelligence, or EQ, on the other hand recognises that success isn’t only determined by a person’s academic ability, but that our ability to identify, assess and control emotions has a huge role to play as well. People with a strong EQ have the ability to manage emotions, and use those emotions to help establish stronger relationships with others.</p>
 
        <p>Think of IQ as the ‘book smarts’ and EQ as the ‘street smarts’.</p>
 
        <h2>The Importance of Emotional Intelligence</h2>
          
        <p>Cultivating an understanding of emotional intelligence is important given that our emotions play a huge role in both our personal and professional interactions, behaviors and decision making processes.</p>
          
        <p>In life, we frequently deal with situations that test us. Emotional Intelligence helps us to better navigate pressure situations such as dealing with feedback, deadlines, challenging relationships, navigating change and managing failure as we step back, and recognise the emotions which might be generated as a result of these pressures, then better determine how to approach a situation.</p> 
          
        <p>Emotional intelligence can also be beneficial in helping us to accept criticism and responsibility for our actions. It enables us to build stronger relationships with others, through understanding and recognition.</p>
          
        <p>In a workplace environment, emotional intelligence is seen as being of fundamental importance for those who wish to progress to any sort of leadership or management position. A key part of these positions involves making tough decisions, dealing with high pressure situations and managing teams of people - for all of which, emotional intelligence is key!</p>
 
	      <p>Whilst traditional ideas of intelligence tend to focus solely on IQ, EQ is becoming more and more important and can increasingly be seen to be incorporated in both school education through social and emotional learning, and workplace settings. Life is all about interacting with many different types of people, and navigating and dealing with constant change and surprises. Emotional intelligence helps us to keep our emotions in check, recognizing that they are fleeting feelings which will come and go, but they don’t necessarily have to dictate how we behave. As important as it is to recognise those feelings, we also need to be able to regulate them, and have an understanding that our actions and behaviors can impact those around us.</p>
