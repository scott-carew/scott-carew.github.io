        <h1>Planning to Learn or Learning to Plan?</h1>
        <h3 id="date">22 April 2022</h3>
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>Long term goals are something I have always struggled with, and still, I don’t have a clear idea of my next step after completing the Dev Academy course. Part of what inspired me to take the leap, was the drive to pursue a career, and gain technical skills in a specific field where I can continue to grow and develop within an industry which is forward thinking that provides workplace flexibility. 
        </p>
        <p>At this stage, being completely new to web development, it’s a bit of a case of ‘you don’t know what you don’t know’! I’m feeling open and excited by the opportunity ahead, and I’m hoping as I begin to learn more about the industry, I’ll be able to make a more informed decision about my long-term path!
        </p>
        <h2>Strengths and Limitations in Learning</h2>
        <p>I think my hardworking, dedicated and meticulous nature could be both a blessing, and a potential curse in the learning process. I don’t have a problem putting time into projects, but I need to ensure that the time I do put in is productive and worthy - balanced with a healthy amount of downtime!
        </p>
        <p>I don’t like it when I don’t understand something, however at times, I also overlook the basics as I try to take on too much which generally leads to me becoming overwhelmed and inefficient. With this in mind, taking an approach of ‘Keep It Simple Stupid’ coupled with ‘Work Smarter Not Harder’ and an understanding that ‘perfect’ is not necessarily best practice will be the key to my success.         
        </p>
        <h2>Let’s Talk Core</h2>
        <p>The emphasis Dev Academy places on developing human skills was a key factor which influenced my decision to apply for this course! Some of of the non-technical skills that I would like to see developed include:          
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learning to manage expectations and be kind to myself.</li>
          <li>Goal setting</li>
          <li>Maintaining focus on the task at hand</li>
          <li>Managing priorities</li>
          <li>Communication - this might include asking for help in a timely manner instead of trying to do everything myself when I’m stuck, and dealing with potentially awkward situations which might arise in team environments - in an appropriate manner.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Workload & Self Care</h2>
        <p>The course, for the next three months will ultimately be my primary commitment. For the most part, I have very few scheduled commitments which would get in the way of me completing the tasks. Throughout the day, my parents are both at work, and I have a separate study place where I’m able to work - free from distraction - when people are at home. During Bootcamp, being able to use the Re-leased office environment, and work with other students and my mentor will also be awesome!
        </p>
        <p>After only a couple of weeks, I’ve discovered how easy it is to fall down rabbit holes, and I think it’s important for myself to set clear workload expectations. Separating work and relaxation time - ensuring there is time to work, but also to eat, sleep, take a break outdoors and step away from the computer are important, not only for me, but also the people around me. 
        </p>
        <p>Daily mindfulness exercises are something I try to incorporate into my routine at the start of the day, and would like to see progress throughout the day - especially in situations where tensions rise and I start to get overwhelmed. In addition, I’d like to try and be more consistent with incorporating squash games into my weekly schedule as I realize exercise and social contact will be important to both a healthy mind and body. 
        </p>
        <h2>Help Me!</h2>
        <p>When stuck, my go-tos are usually Youtube and Google! That being said, I can often skim read multiple pages instead of taking time to digest the information. As a result, I often end up with 100 tabs open and 3 hours later, twelve other unrelated problems.
        </p>
        <p>Reflecting back on the ‘Think Like a Programmer’ unit from Sprint 1 will be helpful. Breaking down and identifying the problem before I begin my research, and being mindful of the time I spend researching. If I’m still stuck, I will have the option to turn to the appropriate Discord Channel, or, during Bootcamp, my fellow students at Re-Leased, team members I’m working with or on-site mentor. 
        </p>
        <p>In terms of expectations, I’m hopeful for a bit of patience and understanding as I’m not somebody who asks for help easily. That being said, I also don’t expect direct answers. Hopefully a bit of guidance to help me solve the problem and reach an understanding of the solution would be great! One thing I really appreciate is direct and honest feedback with regard to my performance.
