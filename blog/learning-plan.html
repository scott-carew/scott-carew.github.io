          <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>        
          <h3>Still Looking Ahead</h3>
          <p>
            Ultimately, I want to build on the skills learnt during foundations, and gain enough experience with web development to see myself employed as a junior developer. I am acutely aware that by the end of just a few short months, my skill set will still be very basic.  However I hope that I will have learned enough to be gainfully employed in a situation where I can continue to learn, and build on those skills in a workplace environment that is understanding and supporting of this.
          </p>
          <h3>Re-evaluation of Strengths and Limitations</h3>
          <p>
            Both my strengths, and my limitations definitely shone throughout the foundations. Generally speaking, I think I did a pretty good job of committing myself to the work, and ensuring that I was able to get through the workload in a timely and orderly fashion. That being said, there were times where I was distracted, or felt that I wasn’t 100% committed and focussed on the task. I think being mindful of this as I move through bootcamp will be important. I need to find a way to ensure that motivation stays high, even with frustration increases because there were definitely periods of inefficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found that one of my strengths throughout foundations was that I was prepared to help others - when I found that I myself was on top of my understanding. Being an educator, I guess this comes naturally and I think it will be a great strength to take with me into bootcamp as I found it really helpful trying to explain things to others and guide them through. A limitation of this however, is that I’m not always in the mood to help - especially if I myself am stuck.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another limitation to be mindful of, is my tendency to overwork things and stay focussed on the small steps, rather than the bigger picture. I found myself going down rabbit holes on a few occasions during foundations, rather than staying focussed on the smaller task at hand. In the end, this just confused me entirely as I didn’t have a clear picture of my goals. Taking an approach of ‘Keep It Simple Stupid’ is still something I’m working towards.
          </p>
          <h3>Non-Technical Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            Focus and patience will probably be my biggest non-technical challenges throughout bootcamp. In terms of focus, keeping my attention directed towards the task I am working on - similar to what I mentioned above - and not jumping 5 steps ahead will help me in the long run. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Patience, not only towards myself, but others also. In terms of myself, patience might come in the form of showing kindness and understanding towards myself. We’re going to learn a lot, in a short space of time, and not everything is going to stick as quickly or easily as I want it to. Being mindful of the challenge, and setting realistic expectations for myself will be challenging I think. In terms of others, when working in group situations just as I hope others will be patient with me, I need to be patient with them also. I don’t necessarily see this as being an issue, as long as the people I’m working with are engaged and committed to the task. That being said, if I end up working with people who are not engaged or committed, I think this is where I might struggle.
          </p>
          <h3>Non-Technical Development</h3>
          <p>
            At the beginning of foundations, I listed the below points as areas of focus for non-technical development. At this stage, I think they all still hold true, and are reflective of the areas within my limitations which I need to continue working on. Are there more? Probably, however I reckon these are probably the key areas for focus for now.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learning to manage expectations and be kind to myself.</li>
            <li>Goal setting</li>
            <li>Maintaining focus on the task at hand</li>
            <li>Managing priorities</li>
            <li>Communication - this might include asking for help in a timely manner instead of trying to do everything myself when I’m stuck, and dealing with potentially awkward situations which might arise in team environments - in an appropriate manner.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Expectations of the Team</h3>
          <p>
            Thus far, I have been really impressed with the facilitators that I have dealt with. Everyone seems to be very supportive and encouraging which is great, and I’m sure this will continue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, I’m hoping that the facilitators will continue to guide learning in a way that ensures that we as students hold ourselves accountable for our own learning and progress. That being said, there will be times where I am stuck, and need some guidance. I hope that the facilitators will be understanding and patient during times of frustration, and won’t simply provide the answer, but rather respond to requests for help in a way that will help guide me towards finding and understanding a solution. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of the check-ins with both the human skills facilitator, and the end of phase Tech-in, I’m hoping that these will be productive meetings, where honest feedback on development and progress can be shared. I appreciate feedback, and whilst encouragement is great, I also appreciate when feedback is direct and honest so I can get a real gauge of how I am progressing.
          </p>
          <h3>Expectations of Self</h3>
          <p>
            I am committed to making Dev Academy Bootcamp my primary focus for the 9 weeks duration of the course. I have an awesome opportunity to utilize the resources and team at Re-Leased, Napier, and I want to ensure that I do my best to make it into their office space each and every day to complete my work. I expect that I should take time each week to review and make adjustments to my learning plan, and prepare for check-ins with my mentor and facilitator by taking time to address questions and concerns prior to those meetings to ensure that our time can be spent together as productively as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the bootcamp process, I need to ensure that I take time each day to check in with myself, and reflect on areas where I have shown growth and improvement, and also to identify areas that I am still struggling with, and dress those concerns in order to try and overcome them.
          </p>
          <p>
            When working on tasks, either individually or part of a group, I will be a present, focussed, and willing participant towards the task at hand. I’m committed to at least attempt to show patience, both towards myself and others, and understand that learning is a process that happens differently for different people. When I need help. I won’t be afraid to reach out and ask for it - after I have put in a fair attempt to solve the problem myself first - using the problem solving techniques that we’ve focussed on throughout foundations.

          <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
          <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
          <p>Long term goals are something I have always struggled with, and still, I don’t have a clear idea of my next step after completing the Dev Academy course. Part of what inspired me to take the leap, was the drive to pursue a career, and gain technical skills in a specific field where I can continue to grow and develop within an industry which is forward thinking that provides workplace flexibility. 
          </p>
          <p>At this stage, being completely new to web development, it’s a bit of a case of ‘you don’t know what you don’t know’! I’m feeling open and excited by the opportunity ahead, and I’m hoping as I begin to learn more about the industry, I’ll be able to make a more informed decision about my long-term path!
          </p>
          <h3>Strengths and Limitations in Learning</h3>
          <p>I think my hardworking, dedicated and meticulous nature could be both a blessing, and a potential curse in the learning process. I don’t have a problem putting time into projects, but I need to ensure that the time I do put in is productive and worthy - balanced with a healthy amount of downtime!
          </p>
          <p>I don’t like it when I don’t understand something, however at times, I also overlook the basics as I try to take on too much which generally leads to me becoming overwhelmed and inefficient. With this in mind, taking an approach of ‘Keep It Simple Stupid’ coupled with ‘Work Smarter Not Harder’ and an understanding that ‘perfect’ is not necessarily best practice will be the key to my success.         
          </p>
          <h3>Let’s Talk Core</h3>
          <p>The emphasis Dev Academy places on developing human skills was a key factor which influenced my decision to apply for this course! Some of of the non-technical skills that I would like to see developed include:          
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learning to manage expectations and be kind to myself.</li>
            <li>Goal setting</li>
            <li>Maintaining focus on the task at hand</li>
            <li>Managing priorities</li>
            <li>Communication - this might include asking for help in a timely manner instead of trying to do everything myself when I’m stuck, and dealing with potentially awkward situations which might arise in team environments - in an appropriate manner.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Workload & Self Care</h3>
          <p>The course, for the next three months will ultimately be my primary commitment. For the most part, I have very few scheduled commitments which would get in the way of me completing the tasks. Throughout the day, my parents are both at work, and I have a separate study place where I’m able to work - free from distraction - when people are at home. During Bootcamp, being able to use the Re-leased office environment, and work with other students and my mentor will also be awesome!
          </p>
          <p>After only a couple of weeks, I’ve discovered how easy it is to fall down rabbit holes, and I think it’s important for myself to set clear workload expectations. Separating work and relaxation time - ensuring there is time to work, but also to eat, sleep, take a break outdoors and step away from the computer are important, not only for me, but also the people around me. 
          </p>
          <p>Daily mindfulness exercises are something I try to incorporate into my routine at the start of the day, and would like to see progress throughout the day - especially in situations where tensions rise and I start to get overwhelmed. In addition, I’d like to try and be more consistent with incorporating squash games into my weekly schedule as I realize exercise and social contact will be important to both a healthy mind and body. 
          </p>
          <h3>Help Me!</h3>
          <p>When stuck, my go-tos are usually Youtube and Google! That being said, I can often skim read multiple pages instead of taking time to digest the information. As a result, I often end up with 100 tabs open and 3 hours later, twelve other unrelated problems.
          </p>
          <p>Reflecting back on the ‘Think Like a Programmer’ unit from Sprint 1 will be helpful. Breaking down and identifying the problem before I begin my research, and being mindful of the time I spend researching. If I’m still stuck, I will have the option to turn to the appropriate Discord Channel, or, during Bootcamp, my fellow students at Re-Leased, team members I’m working with or on-site mentor. 
          </p>
          <p>In terms of expectations, I’m hopeful for a bit of patience and understanding as I’m not somebody who asks for help easily. That being said, I also don’t expect direct answers. Hopefully a bit of guidance to help me solve the problem and reach an understanding of the solution would be great! One thing I really appreciate is direct and honest feedback with regard to my performance.
