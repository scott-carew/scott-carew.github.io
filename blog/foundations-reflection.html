      <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
      <h3 id="date">12 May 2022</h3>
      <p>
        Wow! It's hard to believe that five weeks have come and gone already, and that we are nearing the end of foundations and gearing up to get into the juicy side of things - bootcamp! What a whirlwind of mixed emotions these last five weeks have been. Frustration, joy, confusion, doubt, self-consciousness, pride, and optimism to name just a short few. I guess foundations has lived up to it's name in laying the groundwork for what I'm sure will only intensify over the coming weeks. For now though, time to reflect.
      </p>
      <h2>Core Learnings</h2>
      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>
        I guess I knew prior to the beginning of foundations, that I had issues being able to identify my core values, and to find an answer of that long sought after question - 'Who am I?'. After 5 weeks, do I have an answer? Well, no. No I don't. But, did I expect to have an answer? Also no. What the core curriculum did do however, was make me sit down and do a bit of self discovery which would help me progress in my journey towards identifying components which might help me answer pieces of this question. Instead of focussing on the negative (a bad habit of mine), it also made me address some of the positives, really focus on some of my strengths and get a better understanding of what drives me to do the work that I do.
      </p>
      <h3>Embrace the Discomfort of Learning - It's for Everyone</h3>
      <p>
        I found the research into neuroplasticity and growth mindset to be particularly helpful on this journey. Whilst I know that I'm not an unintelligent person, at times I have strong doubts about my abilities to understand new topics, and recall information. I guess this investigation helped to solidify my understanding that the learning process SHOULD be uncomfortable - and that this is OK. Learning happens in a zone of discomfort, where we are unfamiliar with new material. The material needs to be challenging, to keep us engaged, whilst at the same time, not too challenging that we start to become overwhelmed and lose motivation all together. For me personally, having this understanding created a drive to continue, especially during moments where I felt stuck, and really didn't know if I was going to be able to move forward. During these moments, it's helpful to remember the fundamentals of growth mindset, and I found myself using 'not yet' statements quite frequently. I guess I learnt that learning is a process that everyone is capable of - me included.

      <h3>Celebrate Good Times</h3>
      <p>
        This entire foundations journey has been humbling to say the least. When I think back to the week before foundations began, I didn't even know what the terminal was - let alone how to find it! It has been a crash course from wo to go. During the core learning process, I've really been able to reflect on my learning process, and put my ego into check. It's helped me reflect on just how little I know about this topic of web development - and how much there is to learn. One of the takeaways will be the importance of celebration. I think this came up, less in the core learnings, but in the prep material when I was reading up about habits, and how important it is to celebrate success when you're trying to build new habits. I think this too should be applied to learning. Too often, it's easy to get bogged down, and shrug off success by focussing on what it is that you still don't know. Whilst this can be important, to keep the ego in check, it's just as important to celebrate the small wins along the path to improvement.
      </p>
      <h2>Values, Empathy and Self-Awareness</h2>
      <p>
        Our values shape not only who we are, but they are the 'why' behind a lot of our thoughts and our actions. By having a solid understanding of our own personal values, we have a better connection with ourselves and can more readily identify what strengths we bring along with us on our learning journey, and what limitations we have which might require additional support and nourishment when we encounter problems and challenges. Our values largely determine our attitude and approach to different situations. Learning should not only be a journey of academic development, but also personal development as well. As we continue this journey, our personal values will have a big role to play, as they will determine how we approach tasks, problems and situations where we have to work in collaboration with others as is so often the way in the programming industry. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy refers to our ability to connect with others on a human level, and to share and understand their feelings. Just I have my strengths, my weaknesses and my own personal emotions, it is important to remember that each and every other person has theirs too. No two people are alike, and when you are working in close proximity with others, in high pressure situations, it's crucial to have an understanding and respect towards the feelings and situation of your peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        An awareness of self is always important when it comes to learning. As I mentioned above, each and every person is different, and I am no exception to that. Self awareness through the learning process will help me better understand what works for me, and what doesn't work for me in different situations. An awareness of my learning style, my approach and my emotions will hopefully ensure that I can communicate these things with my peers, my facilitators and my future colleagues in order to get the most out of each and every learning opportunity.
      </p>
      <h2>Surprise Surprise</h2>
      <p>I guess the most surprising thing about core learning was fundamentally how basic it all was. Let's be honest, none of it is rocket science, or particularly difficult to understand - yet all of it is incredibly helpful not only for learning, but life in general! During my time studying education, I had already touched on much of what was learned during the core learning component of foundations, so it wasn't entirely new to me, however I definitely think that when you get bogged down with day to day life, or overwhelmed when approaching something new, it's always helpful to revisit these concepts as a reminder.</p>
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        I think for me, probably the most challenging part of the core learning, is practicing what you learn, and remembering to turn to this knowledge when times get tough! It's easy to read some internet articles, watch some videos, and connect with the ideas presented in core learning. However, when you are actually faced with difficult situations, or feeling overwhelmed in a moment of stress or general uncertainty - reflecting back on those learnings and putting them into practice is challenging. I feel that a lot of the information from core learning, can be applied through building positive and healthy habits - not my strongest skillset! Patience, persistance and kindness to self are key though.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Focus on Core?</h2>
      <p>
        Dev Academy, from the moment I learned about them have placed the importance of core at the forefront of their education plan. Why? Because developing human skills seems to be equally, if not more important than the technical side of things. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst studying education, we focussed on the 21st century skills required to teach students of the future. Work places will embrace employees who excel in critical thinking, citizenship, growth mindset, creativity, communication and collaboration. In essence, these skills mostly represented through the core curriculum. Dev Academy places so much importance on these skills because it realises that these are the skills that employers want - and whilst the concepts of the core curriculum might be pretty basic, as I mentioned earlier, they are a case of "easier said than done".
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to this, the Bootcamp style of education isn't easy. Infact, based on what I've already experienced in the last 5 weeks, and from what I've heard, I'm anticipating that it's going to be pretty bloody difficult! By coupling core material with tech material, Dev Academy is better equipping it's students to be understand problems in a variety of ways, and better navigate ourselves and others.
      </p>
      <h2>Was it Worth It?</h2>
      <p>
        Absolutely! The core curriculum was one of my key reasons for wanting ot join Dev Academy. In addition to the general self development which I wanted to go through (and have been pleased with thus far), I just think it's actually nice during the week to take some time out from the technical side of things, and focus on learning concepts that can be related back to all aspects of your general self. Human's are complex creatures, and I think we all deserve to take some additional time to get to know ourselves better, and work on skills that will also help us relate to others better as well. Some people might see it as 'fluff', but ya know what, I like the fluff!
