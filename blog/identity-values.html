        <h1>Identity & Values</h1>
        <h3 id="date">15 April 2022</h3>
        <h2>Core Values</h2>
        <p>If I were to string together a list of some of my core personal values, they would be as follows: integrity, dependability, kindness, openness, adventurous, cooperation, loyalty, hardworking and fairness.
        </p>
        <p>I strongly believe that there is a right, and a wrong way to treat people. In my mind, all people, regardless of their cultural background, sexual orientation, gender associations, economic status, physical/intillectual capabilities or other, have the right to be treated equally, and fairly.
        </p>
        <p>In reflecting upon my personal values, I think it would be fair to say that I am an incredibly caring, and loyal person who strongly values other people’s opinions, and works hard to ensure that I am doing the best I can to help and cooperate with others in order to achieve common goals. I believe that I have a strong work ethic, and am not afraid of putting in the hard yards to get a job completed.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to these, I strongly value adventure. I believe that life is there to be lived, and we can enrich ourselves through our own personal experiences, and through learning from the experiences of others. 
        </p>
        <h2>An Ethical Decision</h2>
        <p>In a previous job as an academic coordinator at an international school, I was faced with an end of year parent meeting, where I had to relay to the parent that her child, who had already repeated grades one and two, had failed the year on an accelerated program. 
        </p>
        <p>The school had a path for her child to progress, however this would require the child to repeat grade two for a second time. Senior administration was keen to get the parent on board, as increasing enrollment was a primary goal, however, I made the decision to tell the parent that this school was not the right school for her child. I knew the support mechanisms which were needed by the child were not in place at this school. There was no special needs coordinator, and the education model which the school followed - a one size fits all approach - had not served the child well and evidence suggested it was unlikely to do any better in the future. It seemed to me that having the child repeat another year, was just not the right approach for his education.
        </p>
        <p>Despite my efforts to convince the parent to change schools, she decided to re-enroll. As I didn’t continue with the school the previous year, I’m not entirely sure what happened, though my understanding from teachers who remained is that little improvement took place. 
        </p>
        <p>Reflecting back on the experience, I was able to offer the parent my opinion, however I wasn’t able to give a solid alternative to help resolve the situation. I knew in my heart that this school was not the place for him, but ultimately, it wasn’t my decision, and because (perhaps) I wasn’t able to give a reasonable alternative, no change was made.
        </p>
        <h2>The Influence of Culture</h2>
        <p>Both of my parents are incredibly hard working individuals with a strong sense of right and wrong and that has definitely had an impact in shaping who I am. In whatever job I undertake, I always put my best foot forward, and try to ensure that if I say I’ll do something, it will get done. I take pride in the fact that I can be relied upon, and will always try my best to ensure a task is done.
        </p>
        <p>I think Kiwis in general are known for their open-mindedness and tolerance for others. Despite this stereotype however, it wasn’t always my experience growing up in a minority group. When you’re young, being ‘different’ can be difficult and most of us at that age, I think, just wanted to fit in. I think I spent a lot of my childhood trying to ‘fit in’ and ‘fly under the radar’ which I believe has had both positive and negative implications on my identity. On the positive side, I am very accepting of others for who they are, however on flipside, despite my age, I think I still have a lot of work to do when it comes to figuring out who I am, what drives me, and being proud of the person I have become.
        </p>
        <p>Growing up in New Zealand, I gained an appreciation of the outdoors (as many of us do in this beautiful country), and whilst I’d consider myself to be both risk averse and accident prone, I think this, along with my parents’ appreciation of these things, sparked an adventurous nature in me. I love to explore new places, gain new experiences, meet new people and appreciate the beauty that this world has to offer. 
        </p>
        <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
        <p>Strengths: Hard work, dedication, detail oriented, methodical, problem solver, loyalty and integrity are some of the strengths that I align more recently (because it wasn’t always the case) with my learning and career development. I’m proud to say that in my recent education efforts, I have always put my best foot forward, to ensure I get the most out of the learning experience and achieve positive results. 
        </p>
        <p>As far as my work is concerned, I have done exactly the same and received many instances of positive feedback from employers, colleagues, parents, and students which speak to my dedicated and caring nature.
        </p>
        <p>Limitations: While the positives shine, there are many limitations that I am well and truly aware of. The hardwork and dedication which I speak of above, come with consequences. In general, I am a person who avoids conflict, and prefers to just put my head down, and get the job done. This can have limitations in the sense that I often find it difficult to strike a healthy work/life balance - often overworking myself to the detriment of both my physical and mental health.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to this, I am a chronic overthinker/overplanner and frequently plagued with indecision as my meticulous nature strives to come up with a ‘perfect’ response or ‘the right answer’. Ultimately, more often than not, this leads to self doubt, and inefficiency as I tend to lose focus, flit from task to task and waste a lot of time dealing with hypotheticals rather than just getting on with the reality and getting the work done.
        </p>
        <h2>Towards the Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>My strengths will serve me well as I progress on this learning journey because I know that I have it in me to complete new and difficult tasks. I’m not concerned with hard work, I have proven time and again that I can get the job done. When problems do arise, I have it in me to solve them by methodically analyzing them and using my skills to solve them - that would seem to be advantageous in this line of work.
        </p>
        <p>What I do need to be concerned about, are my limitations. Already this week, a loss of focus, self doubt and over thinking have plagued me. I need to ensure that these are kept in check throughout my learning journey, by focussing on how I can complete smaller steps as I work towards the larger goal.
        </p>
        <h2>A Tense Situation</h2>
        <p>Going back to a previous job, I worked closely  with a colleague for whom I didn’t have a lot of respect. We differed a lot in terms of our personalities and work ethic. Whilst I don’t consider myself to be perfect, I do work hard, try to do my best, and will willingly admit when I have made a mistake, I don’t know an answer or how to fix a problem. She was quite the opposite. 
        </p>
        <p>I’d spend a lot of my time and effort, creating complex exam schedules and performing other tasks, which were actually her job and not mine. My mentality at the time was just to put my head down, and get the job done - I guess ego came into place with the age old ‘If you want something done right, do it yourself’. 
        </p>
        <p>Conflict would often arise, when problems occurred because again, our approach differed. Where I would always try to focus on how we can fix a problem, her approach generally centered around pointing any blame away from herself. I tried my best to remain calm and objective, however I tend to wear my emotions on my sleeve, and I think a lot of the time, my subconscious opinions of the situation interfered and escalated the tension, rather than resolving it.
        </p>
        <p>In hindsight, I think there are a few points that I’d change here. First would be understanding. I never really had a clear understanding of expected task distribution in our roles, and as a result, often took on more work than I needed to - this added a layer of stress. I think a bit of mindfulness would be helpful also. As I tend to avoid conflict situations, at times I can avoid speaking up if I feel my opinions are going to spark conflict, or, when I do speak up, my message is often lost with emotion. Practicing a bit of mindfulness can help clear the head, and remove the emotion from these situations - ultimately having a positive impact on communication and the interactions with others.
